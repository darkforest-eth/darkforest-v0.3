# Dark Forest

Dark Forest is an massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS) space conquest game build on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Structure

The Dark Forest repository is composed of three main components

1. `/client` contains the game's user interface
2. `/eth` contains the game's smart contract code
3. `/circuits` contains the game's zkSNARKS circuits writen in [Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom)

## Development Guide

### Installing Core Dependencies

-   Node (v12.18.0)
-   Yarn (Javascript Package Manager)
-   Ganache CLI

#### Installing The Correct Node Version Using NVM

Dark Forest is built and tested using Node.js v12.18.0 and might not run properly on other Node.js versions. We recommend using NVM to switch between multiple Node.js version on your machine.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
nvm install
```

After the installation is finished, you can run `node --version` to verify that you are running v12.18.0

#### Installing Yarn & Other Dev Dependencies

Refer to [Yarn's official documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for the installation guide.

After you have Yarn installed, run the following commands in the root directory to install the remaining dev dependencies:

```
yarn global add ganache-cli
yarn install
```

### Client Development Setup

All of our client related code is located in the `/client` directory.

Currently, after following the setup below, you will be able to have a locally running client that will point towards the current playtest contract on Ropsten. The production contract address is stored in `/client/src/utils/prod_contract_addr.ts`.

**Navigate to the `/client` folder and run the following commands:**

```
yarn install
yarn start:prod
```

### Smart Contract Development Setup

All of our smart contract related code is located in the `/eth` directory.

-   `/eth/contracts` contains the smart contract code written in solidity
-   `/eth/test` contains the test for the smart contract written in Javascript

#### Installing Dependenciees

**Navigate to the `/eth` folder and run the following commands:**

```
yarn add scrypt
yarn install
```

Note: We run `yarn add scrypt` as a hack too solve a node-gyp error that a lot of our developers have encountered.

#### Running Tests

```
yarn test
```

#### Deploying Contracts Locally

We use [OpenZeppelin CLI](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/2.8/) to manage the deployment of our contracts instead of using Truffle. We use it because it works out of the box with OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract system.

You can easily deploy contract locally by running the local deployment at the project root directory:

Note: You will need ganache-cli for this to run properly.

```
./local-deploy.sh
```

For more information regarding Dark Forest's smart contract architecture, see the README.md file inside the `/eth` directory.
